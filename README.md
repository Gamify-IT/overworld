## Getting started

### Run with Docker-compose

Start all dependencies with our docker-compose files.
Check the [manual for docker-compose](https://github.com/Gamify-IT/docs/blob/main/dev-manuals/languages/docker/docker-compose.md).

Note: This repositorys `docker-compose-dev.yaml` doesn't work in the same way as in the other repositories.
Here this file pulls the main docker image from GitHub instead of not pulling any image and enabling you to run the 
project locally.
